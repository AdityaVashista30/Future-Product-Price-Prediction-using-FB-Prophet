# Future-Product-Price-Prediction-using-FB-Prophet
It is a simple price prediction and data visualization project which used Facebook Prophet to make future predictions of prices of Avocado in the USA as a part of a guided project

Before predicting future prices, the dataset was visualized and analyzed, as each attribute as compared to the price of the product and categorical attributes were also compared categorically also.

In this project data for prices for each day of the next year is predicted for:
    
    1. Average price across USA for that day
    2. Average price across sub region: West
    3. Average price across sub region: Chicago
    
For the above three predictions the following graphs are visualized:
    
    1.Date vs Average Price
    2. Trend
    3.Yearly observation wrt to month
 
 
 Pre-requiste libraries: fbprophet, seaborn
